# fraternity mass text system

This was a backend server I wrote for an angular app for my college fraternity. It handled broadcasting mass texts to all of the authorized fraternity members.

The angular application or a nexmo number could be used to send out a mass text if the user was authorized to send them (they were logged into the angular application or they sent a text from the number in the authorized number database).
